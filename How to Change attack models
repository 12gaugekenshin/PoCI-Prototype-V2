File to edit: models.py

The engine uses two base classes:
class HonestModel(BaseModel): pass
class AttackerModel(BaseModel): pass

But the behavior is controlled in run_demo.py, not the model class itself.


Make a Model Always Attack

You can force a model to always produce bad signatures:

model = AttackerModel("attacker_0")
event = model.make_event(store, "payload", cheat=True)

or change every call in Phase 2:

attack = attacker.make_event(store, f"atk-{i}", cheat=True)

Make a “Chaotic” Model (sometimes cheats, sometimes honest)

Add this in run_demo.py:

import random

def maybe_cheat(p=0.3):
    return random.random() < p

Then generate events like:


event = chaotic_model.make_event(store, f"chaos-{i}", cheat=maybe_cheat(0.3))


Make a “Drifter” Model (lies with timestamps)

In models.py, override the timestamp logic:

class DrifterModel(BaseModel):
    def make_event(self, store, payload, cheat=False):
        ev = super().make_event(store, payload, cheat)
        # artificially drift time forward or backward
        ev.ts += random.randint(-3, 3)
        return ev

This intentionally breaks monotonicity — the controller will catch it.

Make a “Payload-Liar” (claims output it never computed)

Everything in PoCI is anchored by:

payload_commit = BLAKE2b(payload)

To simulate lying about the payload:

event = liar.make_event(store, "real payload")
event.payload = "fake payload"

The controller will detect mismatched commitments.

Make a “Shadow Attacker” (copies someone else’s prev_hash)

event.prev_hash = honest.prev_hash

This breaks lineage — watch the controller slam its weight.

Adjust Trust Sensitivity

In controller.py, change these:

self.weight += 30   # reward for GOOD
self.weight -= 60   # penalty for BAD
self.theta  -= 4    # reward
self.theta  += 4    # penalty


Lower values = forgiving
Higher values = brutal

Number of Events per Phase

In run_demo.py:

BOOTSTRAP_EVENTS = 6
ATTACK_EVENTS = 12

Change those to anything you want.

Want multiple attackers or multiple honest models?

honest2 = HonestModel("honest_b")
attacker2 = AttackerModel("atk_b")
